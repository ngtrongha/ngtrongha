  Why this version is better:

  1. Stronger Headlines: Instead of "I am a dev," it uses "Mobile App Architect," which sounds more authoritative to recruiters.
  2. Highlighting Specialized Skills: It specifically mentions Mobile Computer Vision and Clean Architecture, which are high-value skills in the current market.
  3. Project Context: It explains why your face_detection_camera project is impressive (ML Kit, Real-time processing, Modular architecture) rather than just listing it.
  4. Visual Professionalism: Uses standardized badges and clean Markdown formatting.
